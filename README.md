# Installation-configuration-by-SCRIPT

The Script helps to :- Install API gateway in unattended form, if required install &amp; start cassandra, register HOST, create group and instance, If require  set up API manager &amp; if require Install Analytics

For configuration we have used one text file. Every time you want to create a Env/topology you just need to configure the text file and just enter the name of the components that are required to be installed and proper IP's/hostnames.

The Good thing is that Script does every thing in VERBOSE so you could see all the step like where the cassandra is started, when instance is created, when api manager is configured. Hence in case of any failure you would be able to trace down very easily.

# Features!

    - The Script is based on the general installation structure of the API gateway and can be used with any version i have tested it with 753 and 762.
    - It is lot faster then compared to manual installation.
